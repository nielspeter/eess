## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 928ce4a: Fold ts-archunit's fail-closed engine into the kernel (plan 0088), porting
  its ADR-008/ADR-009 doctrine as eess ADR-009 (Agent-First Failure Surfaces)
  and ADR-010 (A Pass Is Constructed From Evidence).

  **Breaking (0.x — minor signals it, not a 1.0 stability claim):**
  - **A rule that examines zero units now throws by default.** Previously,
    many rule shapes silently passed when a predicate matched nothing, a
    glob resolved to no files, or a project loaded no source at all —
    indistinguishable from "correctly found nothing wrong." That's now an
    unsuppressable configuration finding (`bypassFilters: true` on the
    violation) unless declared intentional with the new `.expectEmpty()`
    chain method. `.excluding()` and inline exclusion comments cannot
    silence it; ordinary `.check({ baseline })`/`.check({ diff })` filtering
    doesn't either.
    **Migration:** if a rule you own legitimately expects an empty corpus
    right now (mid-migration, a folder not yet populated), add
    `.expectEmpty()` to the chain. Everything else needs no change — the
    new throw only fires where the rule's own instrument was already silently
    broken.
  - **A held selection is no longer mutated by chain methods.**
    `.that()`/`.excluding()`/`.rule()`/`.because()`/`.expectEmpty()` (and
    `RuleBuilder`'s `.addPredicate()`/`.addCondition()`) now return an
    independent copy instead of mutating `this` — a real bug fix (a second
    rule built from a held selection could previously inherit the first
    rule's narrowing/exclusions/id silently). Code that relied on the old
    in-place mutation (holding a builder variable across multiple mutating
    calls and expecting each call's effect to be visible through the
    original reference) will behave differently — correctly. No known
    consumer code does this; it's named here in case any does.
  - **`eess-ts`'s `layeredArchitecture()` preset's `restrictedPackages`
    option now correctly enforces.** It silently under-enforced before (a
    discarded accumulator only worked by accident under the old mutation
    semantics) — an existing ruleset using this option may see new,
    correct violations it was never actually checking for.

  **Unchanged:** predicate/condition semantics and names, rule syntax,
  `// eess-ts:disable` comment syntax, `arch-baseline.json`'s format,
  `ruleId`/`because`/`Fix:`/`Docs:` violation fields, the existing
  `eess-ts` test suite (1961 tests) — only ~13 of which needed updating,
  each because it asserted the old silent-pass as if it were a feature,
  not because any rule-authoring API changed.

  **New, exported from both `@nielspeter/eess` and `@nielspeter/eess-ts`:**
  `CollectResult`, `.expectEmpty()`/`.expectNonEmpty()` (the latter is the
  sharper opposite — it overrides a `.notExist()`-shaped condition's own
  cardinality exemption, reddening if the corpus you declared "must have
  subjects" doesn't), `marksAssertsCardinality`/`assertsCardinality` (the
  extension point for a custom `defineCondition()` to gain the same
  exemption `.notExist()` has), `Matcher`, `BaselineFilter`/`DiffFilterLike`.
  `reportViolations`/`finishPreset` are now also reachable from
  `@nielspeter/eess-ts/presets` for a standalone consumer building a custom
  preset.

  `@nielspeter/eess-md`, `-mermaid`, `-gherkin`, `-crossvalidate` ship no
  source changes of their own in this release — the minor bump tracks the
  kernel's dependency range (their `RuleBuilder<T, P>`/`correspondence()`
  usage inherits the new evidence gate for free) and, per plan 0088's own
  "family boundary" note, is a live capability the moment a consumer
  upgrades: an existing rule in any of these dialects that silently passed
  on an empty corpus will now throw too, not staged behind a later opt-in.
